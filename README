schranzd - Schranz Daemon
Stupid, unfinished tool I made to make mail accounts administration easier for users, with possibility for adding extentions.
It's written quickly, a little thoughtlessly, it lacks many functionalities and really needs work and polishing.
I made it public because maybe someone will find it useful, fork it and extend.

As for July 10th it isn't finished and doesn't yet work.

What it supports:
* Daemon which uses gevent to listen on UNIX socket. It reads user credentials from socket.
* JSON-based protocol
* mail module - it allows creating accounts for postfix+dovecot configuration with passwdfile-based authentication, along with aliases and catchalls, for multiple domains.

What it still needs:
* solid thought how to make it work perfectly within system
* rc script
* logging, better error handling
* mail module doesn't create any map or passwd files, yet
* utility which will merge cached users maps and passwd files into actual configuration.
* working client
* probably code comments, docstrings, documentation, slight refactoring...

Why schranz:
I have music genre based server naming system. My server with mail accounts is schranz.
