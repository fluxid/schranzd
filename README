schranzd - Schranz Daemon
Stupid, unfinished tool I made to make mail accounts administration easier for users, with possibility for adding extentions modules for other tasks.
It's written quickly, a little thoughtlessly, it lacks many functionalities and really needs work and polishing.
I made it public because maybe someone will find it useful, fork it and extend.

What does it support:
* Daemon which uses gevent to listen on UNIX socket. It reads user credentials from socket.
* JSON-based protocol
* mail module - it allows creating accounts for postfix+dovecot configuration with passwdfile-based authentication, along with aliases and catchalls, for multiple domains and users.

What does it need:
* logging, better error handling
* probably code comments, docstrings, documentation...

Why schranz:
I have music genre based server naming system. My server with mail accounts is schranz.
